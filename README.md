<h1>Pro codes For KH2FM</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This mods aims to recreate the pro codes feature from KH3. As certain codes are not reproductible in KH2 this mod can be seen as an adaptation.<br/>
  The mod make the game really hard and I don't really know if it is possible to beat. I let super players give us the answer !<br/>
  The mod has not been fully tested so you may encounters some bugs. You can report me those on <a href = https://discord.gg/eXX8pM8pj9>Discord</a> <br/>
You'll find next to this the codes list and some quality of life features.</p>

<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<p>Pro codes are fully compatible with the KH2 randomnizer ! (don't forget to place forms levels on vanilla or junk)</br>
I didn't test it with other mods but it should be compatible with any mod that don't modify those things:</p>
<ul>
  <li><B>03system.bin</B></li>
  <li><B>00battle.bin</B></li>
  <li><B>ennemies object</B></li>
  <li><B>mission's ARD</B></li>
</ul>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>To be able to toggle every pro code this mod come in 3 parts. Open your openKH mod manager and go to <code>Mods > Install a new mod</code>
and type : <code>LMR-C/KH2-pro-codes</code> and press <code>Install</code>. Repeat this step with <code>LMR-C/KH2-pro-codes-no-rc</code> and <code>LMR-C/KH2-pro-codes-no-mickey</code>. Then activate the mods and you're ready to go.<br/>

<h2>Troubleshootings</h2>
<p>The mod has not been tested that much but you should not encounters too much problems.
nevertheless if you see a bug please report it <a href = https://discord.gg/eXX8pM8pj9>here</a></p>
<h3>Known issues</h3>
<ul>
  <li><B>Get all growth ability</B> : All growth abilities quality of life needs to be reset between saves loads. <br/>
    i.e: if you die and want to load a save: disable it load and then enable it. If you already enabled it on the save you want to load just ignore that</li>
  <li><B>ability limit</B> : You can enable as much ability as you want but once you get out of the menu the mod will disable any ability after the 30th enabled (in the game memory order) so keep an eye on your number of equiped abilities
  with <code>R3&nbsp+&nbspL1</code></li>
  <li><B>no cure</B> : For randomnizer : no cure toggling works as intended only for the first save file. It won't works if
  you reboot the game and load a save. And if you changed of savefile during a playthrought you'll get back only the cure you earn in the first one.</li>
  <li><B>no reaction command</B> : seem to not work with HT armored knight and HB hook bat while playing with randomnizer</li>
</ul>
